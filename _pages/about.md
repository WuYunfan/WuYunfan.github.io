# üëã About Me

Hi! I am a **PhD student** at the **Institute of Computing Technology**, Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by **Qi Cao** and **Huawei Shen**.

I graduated from the **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences** with a bachelor‚Äôs degree. 
As part of my undergraduate project, I also had the opportunity to study as an **exchange student** at the **National University of Singapore**.

My research interests include **trustworthy recommender systems**, **graph neural networks**, and **large language models**.
