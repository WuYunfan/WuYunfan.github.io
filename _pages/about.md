# 👋 About Me

Hi! I am **Yunfan Wu**, a fresh **PhD graduate** from the **Institute of Computing Technology**, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was advised by **Qi Cao** and **Huawei Shen**.

I graduated from the **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences** with a bachelor's degree. 
As part of my undergraduate studies, I also had the opportunity to study as an **exchange student** at the **National University of Singapore**.

My research interests include **generative recommendation**, **large language models**, **trustworthy recommender systems**, and **graph neural networks**.
